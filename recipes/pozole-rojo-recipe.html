    <h1>Pozole Rojo</h1>
    <img src="/odin-recipes/images/pozole-rojo.webp">
    <p>It’s perfect for this wishy washy weather we’ve been experiencing in Southern California lately, and even more perfect for days when you just need something comforting to soothe your soul. If you’re not familiar with pozole rojo, or red pozole, it is essentially a hominy stew with chicken or pork and guajillo chile broth.</p>

        <p>Instructions</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large stockpot or dutch oven, cook 1 tbsp of vegetable oil on medium-low heat. Add the chopped white onion, and cook for about 5 minutes until the onion starts to become translucent. Once the onion has been cooking for 5 minutes, add the chopped cilantro, and then add the head of garlic (exposed cloves facing down) and cook for two minutes. Add the thyme, and bay leaves, and cook for two more minutes. Pour in the 6 cups of water and sprinkle in the salt. Add the chicken thighs, and the chicken breasts and bring your stock to a simmer. Once the stock has reached a simmer, reduce the heat to low and cook for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Once the stock and chicken have cooked for an hour, remove the chicken, then strain your stock into a large bowl, and return it to your stock pot or dutch oven. Add the additional 4 cups of water and the cans of hominy with the liquid they’re canned with. Bring the mixture back up to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While that cooks, shred the chicken and make the chile puree: In a medium sized saucepan, add the dried chiles and enough water to cover, bring it to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes to soften. After the 15 minutes, remove the softened peppers and add them to a blender along with the rest of the chile puree ingredients, including the 1/2 cup of the soaking liquid, and blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Dump the rest of the chile soaking liquid out of the saucepan and heat up the vegetable oil in there over medium heat. Once the oil’s hot, carefully add the chile puree and cook for about 15 minutes, until the mixture thickens and turns a slightly darker shade of red. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>After the hominy has been cooking in the stock for 30 minutes, add the puree to the stock and hominy along with the shredded chicken and cook for a final 30 minutes.Taste for salt at this time.</li>
            <li>To serve, plate your pozole and top with your favorite garnishes.</li>
        </ol>
